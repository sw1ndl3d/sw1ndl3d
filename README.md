### Hi there, I'm Connor 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on MalDevAcademy, OSCP, and building out my GitHub README
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Red Team or Offensive Security related
- ☣️ Apologies for the baren repos, I have kept most of them private, as I have been nervous of what people may think of my notes and work! I will be work-shopping this!
